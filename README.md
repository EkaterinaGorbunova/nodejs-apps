# Description

This repository showcases a variety of small applications built with Node.js, designed to demonstrate my skills in backend development, asynchronous programming and working with APIs. Each app serves as a unique project, exploring different functionalities and features of Node.js.

# Features

- **Diverse Functionality**: Includes apps for managing inventory, real-time communication and data processing.

- **Asynchronous Programming**: Utilizes `Promises` and `async/await` for efficient, non-blocking code execution.

- **Code Quality**: Each app is structured for clarity and ease of use, ensuring reliable functionality and maintainability.

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive instructions and comments are provided for each app to facilitate understanding and usage.

Feel free to explore the individual projects to see the capabilities of Node.js and my approach to solving various challenges!
